A **Java-based payroll management solution** developed by our team to automate and streamline the salary processing workflow for MotorPH. This system is designed to accurately compute employee wages, deductions, benefits, and government contributions such as **SSS**, **Pag-IBIG**, and **PhilHealth**.

It integrates key HR components like **attendance tracking**, **leave management**, and **employee records** to ensure consistent and efficient payroll operations. By minimizing manual tasks and reducing the risk of human error, our project aims to deliver a **reliable and scalable tool** tailored for real-world business environments.
